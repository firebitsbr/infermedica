    inference engine API. Functions are provided that enable uploading of patientâ€™s health 
    data (such as symptoms, risk factors, lab tests results or demographics) to the
    Infermedica AI inference engine which will analyze it and return a list of likely 
    conditions and relevant observations to verify. For more information please visit
